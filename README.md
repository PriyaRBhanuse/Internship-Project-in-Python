# Internship-Project-in-Python

About

This project aims to analyze customer churn by applying the Random Forest algorithm. The dataset used contains various customer features, such as demographics, usage patterns, and customer service interactions. The project involves:

  Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
  
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the data distribution, identifying key features influencing churn, and visualizing trends.
  
  Modeling: Implementing the Random Forest algorithm to predict customer churn. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  
  Conclusion: Insights from the model help in understanding the key factors contributing to customer churn, which can be used to inform strategies for customer retention.

This project showcases the application of machine learning techniques in solving real-world problems related to customer churn, providing valuable insights for business decision-making.
